You have an app supporting iOS 8, and can't use stack views.  Therefore you have to make hundreds of constraints to make your view presentable across multiple iOS devices.  A very tedious task taking up hours of your time.  So why not hire a magician to do it for you?\r\n\r\nThis is my first open source project, which I am excited to share with you!\r\n\r\nAuto Layout Magic will enable you to design on one screen, and the tool will generate constraints for you!\r\n\r\n![](http://s32.postimg.org/exgxcuix1/Screen_Shot_2016_05_19_at_4_46_46_PM.png)\r\n\r\n## Swift 2 and 3 support!\r\n\r\nThere is full support for Swift 3, thanks to the open source community!  There is also legacy support for Swift 2 by using the Swift_2 branch!\r\n\r\n## Usage example\r\n\r\n[Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfUpann-zG4&feature=youtu.be), for an overview of how to use the tool!\r\n\r\nTarget Screen\r\n\r\n![](http://s32.postimg.org/jme6vesxx/Target_Screen.png)\r\n\r\nBefore Auto Layout Magic, your view will look like this across different devices\r\n\r\n![](http://s32.postimg.org/eekdiueit/Before_Magic.png)\r\n\r\nAfter Auto Layout Magic, your constraints will be created for you, and your view looks great across all iOS devices!\r\n\r\n![](http://s32.postimg.org/fgc6if3t1/After_Magic.png)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nOS X - Requires XCode\r\n\r\nFork or clone the repository, open the project in XCode, build and run the tool.  Once it has been built you can run it at any time as an app.  This app will eventually be uploaded to the app store as a Developer Tool.\r\n\r\n## Release History\r\n\r\n* 1.1\r\n    * Added support for Swift 3.  Made a Swift_2 branch for legacy support\r\n* 1.0\r\n    * Released Auto Layout Magic to the open source community\r\n\r\n## Meta\r\n\r\nAkorda – [@DevAkorda](https://twitter.com/DevAkorda) – akordadev@gmail.com\r\n\r\nDistributed under the MIT license.
