You have an app supporting iOS 8, and can't use stack views.  Therefore you have to make hundreds of constraints to make your view presentable across multiple iOS devices.  So why not hire a magician to do it for you?\r\n\r\nThis is my first open source project, which I am excited to share with you!\r\n\r\nAuto Layout Magic will enable you to design on one screen, and the tool will generate constraints for you!  Let's look at an examle\r\n\r\nTarget Screen\r\n\r\n![](http://s32.postimg.org/jme6vesxx/Target_Screen.png)\r\n\r\nBefore Auto Layout Magic, your view will look like this across different devices\r\n\r\n![](http://s32.postimg.org/eekdiueit/Before_Magic.png)\r\n\r\nAfter Auto Layout Magic, your constriants will be created for you, and your view looks great across all iOS devices!\r\n\r\n![](http://s32.postimg.org/fgc6if3t1/After_Magic.png)\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy, looking forward to working with the community to make this tool great for everyone!\r\n\r\n# <3 Akorda\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
