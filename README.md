# Auto Layout Magic


We've all been there. You have an app supporting iOS 8, and can't use stack views. Therefore you have to make hundreds of constraints to make your view presentable across multiple iOS devices. So why not hire a magician to do it for you?

This is my first open source project, which I am excited to share with you!

Auto Layout Magic will enable you to design on one screen, and the tool will generate constraints for you!

When you break a scene down, each view has a proportional width and height relative to the screen size. It also is placed in an X and Y coordinate, which can be seen as a proportional distance to the main views trailing and bottom edge. This tool will generate those 4 constraints for you, in an attempt make design trivial across multiple screen sizes.
