Hello friends,

We've all been there.  You have an app supporting iOS 8, and can't use stack views.  Therefore you have to make hundreds of constraints to make your view presentable across multiple iOS devices.  A very tedious task taking up hours of your time.  So why not hire a magician to do it for you?

This is my first open source project, which I am excited to share with you!

Auto Layout Magic will enable you to design on one screen, and the tool will generate constraints for you!

## Usage example

Before Auto Layout Magic, your view will look like this across different devices

After Auto Layout Magic, your constraints will be created for you, and your view looks great across all iOS devices!
